# To Do +
# Inspiration
We wanted something that would be useful, productive, and easily created in the real world. We know, as students, that we can feel overwhelmed with the amount of homework and other tasks they must do and often feel like they spend too much time on one task. We wanted to create a new To-Do list that would help students get organized and better manage their time.

# What it does
Our project takes in different tasks, asking for the urgency level, when it is due, and how much time needs to be allotted for the task. The program then takes the tasks and creates an organized schedule based on priority and time constraints. It then sends the amount of time for each task to the timer arduino, which counts down your time for each project, lighting up with the level of importance. When time is up, it waits for you to press a button, saying that you are ready to move on to the next step.

# How we built it
We built the user interface and scheduling feature using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Then we built the timer using C++, Arduino, and bread boards.

# Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges with more complex aspects of Javascript and familiarizing ourselves with the program to code the arduino. One of the biggest challenges we faced was integrating the arduino with the user interface.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Programming the arduino timer to run as hoped and being able to work together as a team.

# What we learned
We learned how to build an arduino program from the ground up. We had very basic knowledge of these programs, but with the help from the mentors we were able to create our final product.

# What's next for ToDo+
We hope that the ToDo+ will be able to be integrated into an app with aesthetically clock.
